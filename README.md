# -Evaluate-and-Analyze-Neural-TTS
This research notebook focuses on the detailed evaluation of high-performance Neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. We analyze key performance characteristics including latency, Real-Time Factor (RTF), expressivity control via SSML, and subjective quality assessment using Mean Opinion Score (MOS).
